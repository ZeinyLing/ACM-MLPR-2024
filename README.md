<b>A Potential Study on the Application of Data Cartography Techniques to Tree-Based Models: A Methodological Approach</b><br><br>
<b>Abstract</b><br>
In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying Data Cartography techniques to tree-based models. Originally designed for classification tasks in large language models, we innovatively adapted these techniques for use with tree-based models such as random forests. This transfer application represents a significant innovation and contribution in terms of model applicability and efficiency, offering a new approach to data analysis and processing for tree-based models. Our research methodology begins by establishing a foundational model based on Data Cartography techniques, opting for a simpler model structure compared to the neural networks used in the original research to better suit the characteristics of tree-based models. We then utilize this foundational model to segment the dataset into three difficulty levels: hard-to-learn, medium-difficulty, and easy-to-learn data. This classification not only enhances the efficiency of model training but also allows us to select more suitable model strategies for different data difficulty levels. Following the classification, we use the model from the first step as the base model to further model the segmented dataset. During this process, we particularly emphasize the application of stacking techniques to improve overall model performance. Our results demonstrate that this approach can effectively enhance the predictive capability of tree-based models on complex datasets, proving the innovative value and practicality of Data Cartography techniques in the context of tree-based model applications.
